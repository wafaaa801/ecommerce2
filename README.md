# VEGEFOOD
VEGEFOOD is a website which was built by using the MVC framework, which is Laravel. Not only that, it is also an e-commerce website which sells various vegetables and fruits, in bulks. It is suitable for supermarkets and farmers to buy fruits and vegetables produce without the need to be physically present at the vendor’s site. Furthermore, since it is still in its development stage, some more features would be added in order to enhance the usability of the website. VEGEFOOD features basic functions that can be found in any other e-commerce website including the following:
